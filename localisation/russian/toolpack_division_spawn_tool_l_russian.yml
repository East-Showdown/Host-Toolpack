toolpack.2.d: "Trying to find out how this tool works? Here's a quick run through of DST A.\n\nFirst, check the four boxes for each of which you want the specified type to spawn. Check "Infantry" to spawn infantry units, "Cavalry" to spawn cavalry units, etc. You can also check multiple boxes to spawn different division types at once.\n\nNext, check one of the eight boxes below "Battalions per Division". If you check the box at "16", the divisions you spawn will have 16 battalions each. You cannot check multiple boxes here.\n\nNow you should select the state that you want the divisions to spawn in. By marking countries, you can spawn divisions from different nations within the selected state. If no country is marked, the divisions will belong to the country which owns the state. Avoid marking multiple countries when spawning in a state that is not controlled by the owner and do not try to spawn too many divisions for too many countries. Your game will lag like mad. \n\nLast but not least, press one of the four buttons below "Spawn Divisions:" to spawn the specified divisions.\n\nBy pressing the "Delete" button at the bottom right, you can delete all units of the selected type for the selected country."
 toolpack.2.a: "Understood."
 toolpack.3.d: "Confused? Read this quick run through DST B.\n\nFirst, select a state in which you want to spawn the divisions.\n\nNext, you press the "Create Template" button up to three times to create as many different templates.You will see three boxes appear, named T1, T2 and T3 respectively. These boxes stand for one template each, so T1 stands for "Toolpack-Division", T2 for "Toolpack-Division 2" and T3 for "Toolpack-Division 3". The next step is to edit the template of the country which will receive the division. To switch to a different country, use the command "tag [tag of desired country]". You can normally find a list of all tags under "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Hearts of Iron IV/common/country_tags/00_countries". Use the two green stars to add or subract army experience.\n\nNow you can specify how well equipped and experienced the divisions should be.\n\nThe second to last step is to define which template you want to spawn. To do this, make checks at T1, T2 or T3 or only two or even all of them.\n\nFinally, you can press any of the four buttons below "Spawn Divisions:" to spawn as many divisions as you want. Keep in mind that you cannot spawn custom divisions of your own country in other countries.\n\nPress the "Delete" button at the bottom right after checking the corresponding boxes to delete all units of all custom templates for the selected country.\n\nWhat you cannot do with this tool: \n- Editing templates in one country and spawning the edited templates in another\n- Spawning renamed templates"
